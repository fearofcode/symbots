Symbots are simple little robots that have wheels and two sensors. They live on the unit square.

They're evolved to seek out a source of energy/light/food at the center of the square.

This code uses the Watchmaker framework: http://watchmaker.uncommons.org

Here is a sample image showing a sample path of an evolved individual randomly placed on the unit square seeking the source at the center of the square.
