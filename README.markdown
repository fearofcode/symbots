Symbots are simple little robots that have wheels and two sensors. They live on the unit square.

They're evolved to seek out a source of energy/light/food at the center of the square.

This code uses the [Watchmaker framework](http://watchmaker.uncommons.org). Watchmaker is on github at @dwdwyer/watchmaker.

Here is a sample image showing a sample path of an evolved individual randomly placed on the unit square seeking the source at the center of the square.

This example comes from a book on evolutionary computation, the [relevant pages of which you can see here](http://goo.gl/cW9GX).

IF you type in ["neuroevolution" on Google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=neuroevolution&hl=en&btnG=Search&as_sdt=1,5), you'll get lots of papers about evolving neural networks for actual useful things, like classifying data and time series prediction.

A readable paper that is widely cited on this topic is:

Randall D. Beer and John C. Gallagher. Evolving dynamical neural networksfor adaptive behavior. Adaptive Behavior, 1:92â€“121, 1992.
